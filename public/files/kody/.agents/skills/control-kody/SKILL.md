# control-kody

Do not invent a throwaway curl script, scrape PR comments by hand, or rediscover
account routes from `routes.ts`. Use the CLI and the Feature Map.

```bash
node tools/control-kody.ts doctor
node tools/control-kody.ts dev
node tools/control-kody.ts login
node tools/control-kody.ts request GET /account/waiting.json
node tools/control-kody.ts map waiting
node tools/control-kody.ts health --sha <merge-sha>
node tools/control-kody.ts preview -- --request 'GET /account/waiting.json' --check /account/waiting
node tools/control-kody.ts package-create --origin <preview> --package-name <leaf-or-@scope/leaf> [--head-ahead]
```

`--kody-id` is an alias for `--package-name`.
`npm run control-kody -- <command>` is the same entry.

## Feature Map

[references/features/README.md](./references/features/README.md) is the
human-readable index. `tools/control-kody/feature-catalog.ts` is the
machine-readable source. `map --check` (and its node test) fail when a listed
path leaves `routes.ts` or a required HTML route has no entry.

Load **one** feature file for the surface you are changing.

## Seed users

- Local: `jane@example.com` / `ilikecode` (non-admin)
- Preview: `me@kentcdodds.com` / `ilikecode` (non-admin, empty until you create
  data through JSON APIs, or `package-create` for a saved package)
- `/admin` 403 and `/mcp` 401 are expected for those seeds

## Proof

CI green is not enough for a user-visible account change. Prefer:

1. `doctor` then `dev` or `preview`
2. `request` / `--check` as the seed user **with data for this change**
3. A computerUse video or screenshot of the same page
4. After merge, `health --origin https://kody.codes --sha <merge>` (full SHA,
   unique short SHA, or a later descendant HEAD that contains the merge)
