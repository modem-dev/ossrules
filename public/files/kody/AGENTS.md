# kody agent index

Kody is a multi-user personal assistant: every signed-in user gets a fully
isolated assistant (own packages, jobs, secrets, memories, remote connectors,
email inboxes, durable storage).

`npm run validate` is the single authoritative local gate.

## Cursor Cloud-specific instructions

Cloud Agent VM gotchas (Node 26 on `PATH`, the Playwright browser-install hang
and manual workaround, dev server, seeding, and local limitations) live in a
dedicated reference:
